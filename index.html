    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Microchip Technology</strong>, Bengaluru, IN<br>
        Software & Machine Learning Engineer<br>
        July 2019 - Aug 2021<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Built Python-based automated triage system (ATS) to expedite log generation & error analysis, saving 5 hours per fault analysis on average.</li>
          <li>Deployed Support Vector Machines (SVM) and linear classifier models using Scikit-learn to assess and categorize product bugs based on type, reproducibility, and source, resulting in a 25% increase in customer acquisition & improved product quality.</li>
          <li>Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques in Python, to recommend test sets and test script selection from Perforce, resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy of the test set selection process by 60%.</li>
          <li>Utilized advanced machine learning algorithms & data modeling techniques to identify patterns & trends in logs, improving the accuracy of the ATS.</li>
          <li>Automated data preprocessing pipeline that optimized data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), transformation & feature engineering tasks, to support machine learning and deep learning model training and testing, leading to a 50% reduction in data preparation time.</li>
          <li>Developed a Machine learning algorithm Random Forest to predict customer churn, achieving 80% accuracy using Python and Scikit-learn.</li>
          <li>Created data visualizations and dashboards using Tableau to communicate actionable insights to executive stakeholders, resulting in improved data-driven decision-making and reduced meeting time.</li>
          <li>Managed daily standup Scrum Agile and maintained the JIRA board to collaborate with cross-functional teams & executed project plans on time.</li
